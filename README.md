# [Fortune-Service](https://fortune-service.herokuapp.com/)

A Spring MVC web application providing you with your daily dose of random sport fortunes.

The idea was inspired from the Udemy course Spring & Hibernate for Beginners (includes Spring Boot) by Chad Darby.

The home page welcomes you to the choice of 3 possible fortune types: Football, Basketball, and Swimming (3 out of 4 of my favorite sports :)). Once you click the submit button, you will be given a random fortune for the fortune type you previously selected.

Deployed, the home page looks like:

With a newly generated fortune:
